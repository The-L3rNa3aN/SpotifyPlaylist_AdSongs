The campaign featured a series of silent advertisements where the consumer of the said beer tapped on the "0% alcohol content" label of the bottle, only to be later pointed at a mistake they had made without knowing it as a twist.

The advertisements had presented the following skits: ["Parking"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNZCe3I_X7o), ["Backstage"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPaGfE851hw), ["Presentation"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRgqiPO1uuE), ["Locker Room"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdA7SZH1T94), ["Photobomb"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FULTlBuk6w) and ["Gas Station"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_tRENCSQtU).
(The official Heineken YouTube channel has age-restricted the videos for some reason.)

Heard in the Garnier Fructis commercials in the 2000s. The original commercials aired in the early 2000s while the Indian commercials aired in the late 2000s. Some of the Indian commercials starred Diva Dhawan, Diana Penty and Jyothsna (the third name needs to be verified).

#### 28. "Welcome Home" by Radical Face.

The skits in both ads feature the same gist, albiet taking place during slightly different scenarios.

#### 30. "Missione A Bombay" by Nicola Conte.
Heard in another Garnier Fructis [advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoV_xfvTViA) which aired in 2011. The gist of this advertisement might have been inspired by Garnier's ["Long and Strong"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDdXZYJYqgQ) advertisement which aired in 2006 and it also makes use of Transplants' "Diamonds and Guns" as their background score like most Fructis ads.
